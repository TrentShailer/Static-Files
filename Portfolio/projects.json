This project dynamically loads in projects from JSON in one of my github repos to allow for easy addition of new projects whenever I need to without needing to update the code. <br /> Many of the components that I created for this can be reused in many other projects, acting as a mini personal UI library that I can customise exactly to my needs. </div>"
